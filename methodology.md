The scan was done through Zenmap, a GUI wrapper for the Nmap security
scanner application. After running a preliminary ping check for
connected addresses, I ran the command \`nmap -sC -sV \--script vuln
\[\...\]\` to execute the vulners NSE script, and interpreted the
results of the scan accordingly.
