The scan detected 10 hosts connected to the network, and accurately
identified IoT: Apple, Windows, and router devices. The exposure was
limited to LAN services, and discovered proper usage of firewalls in
\`filtered\` and \`tcpwrapped\` logs. The network exposes minimal attack
surface. Services observed are consistent with device roles,
authentication is enforced where applicable, and no high-risk
vulnerabilities were identified via automated scanning.
